# Vault

Vault is an API and HTML+js application server for your secrets.

## Usage

Install the dependencies of `vaultd`:

    cd vault-repo-path/vaultd
    make vendor_get
    
Compile `vaultd`:
    
    make

Customize access credentials:

    cp sample_config config.json
    vim config.json

Run the `Secrets Manager` web application, the first time `vaultd` will automatically create its encrypted store:

    ./vaultd -config config.json -app ../vault

Browse `http://localhost:8080/` and login with the credentials you specified in the `config.json` file.

## Export and import stores.

You can export stores and their encrypted records to a JSON file:

    # exports store with id 1 to ~/vault_store_1.json
    ./vaultd -config config.json -output ~/vault_store_1.json -export -store 1 

Or

    # exports all stores to ~/backup.json
    ./vaultd -config config.json -output ~/backup.json -export

Such export files can be later imported with:

    ./vaultd -config config.json -import ~/backup.json

## Screenshots

Both `vaultd` and the `Secrets Manager` app are work in progress, you might experience some differences with the following screenshots.
